We welcome community contribution to this project. Once you implement fine-grained authorization to protect your resources, search becomes a more complex problem, because the user's access to each resource now has to be validated before the resource can be shown. The search problem can then be summarized as: \"Given a particular search filter and a sort order, what objects can the user access\"? The OpenFGA service does not store object metadata (names of files, creation dates, time of last update, etc), which means completing any search request by filtering and sorting according to certain criteria will require data from your database. The services responsible for performing these actions are: Filter: Your database Sort: Your database Authorize: OpenFGA To return the set of results that match the user's search query, you will need to get the intersection of the results from the services above.","s":"Search With Permissions","u":"/integration/advanced/search-with-permissions","h":"","p":7},{"i":10,"t":"There are three possible ways to do this:","s":"Possible Options","u":"/integration/advanced/search-with-permissions","h":"#possible-options","p":7},{"i":12,"t":"Pre-filter, then call OpenFGA Check endpoint.

The number of objects a search query could return from the database is low. Search then Check is the recommended solution. Use-case: Situations where the search query can be optimized to return a small number of results. B. The number of objects of a certain type the user could have access to is low, and the percentage of objects in a namespace a user could have access to is high. Search then Check is recommended to get the final list of results. Note that this use case, because the user has access to a low number of objects which are still a high percentage of the total objects in the system, that means that the total number of objects in the system is low. C. The number of objects of a certain type the user could have access to is low (~ 100), and the percentage of the total objects that the user can have access to is also low. In this case, an API to return the list of all objects a user can access would make sense. You can query this API to get a list of object IDs and then pass these IDs to your filter function to limit the search to them. As this number increases, this solution becomes impractical, because you would need to paginate over multiple pages to get the entire list before being able to search and sort. A partial list from the API is not enough, because you won't be able to sort using it. So while List of IDs then Search would be useful for this in some situations, we would recommend Local Index from Changes Endpoint, Search then Check for the cases when the number of objects is high enough. Until OpenFGA implements an endpoint to return a list of object IDs, local index is recommended for all situations. D. The number of objects of a certain type the user could have access to is high, and the percentage of the total objects that the user can have access to is low. The recommended option for this case is to use Local Index from Changes Endpoint, Search then Check. List of IDs then Search would not work because you would have to get and paginate across thousands or tens of thousands (or in some cases more) of results from OpenFGA, only after you have retrieved the entire set can you start searching within your database for matching results. This would mean that your user could be waiting for a long time before they can start seeing results. Search then Check would also not be ideal, as you will be retrieving and checking against a lot of items and discarding most of them. Use case: Searching in Google Drive, where the list of documents and folders that a user has access to can be very high, but it still is a small percentage of the entire set of documents in Google Drive. E. The number of objects of a certain type the user could have access to is high, and the percentage of the total objects that the user can have access to is also high. In this case a Local Index from Changes Endpoint, Search then Check would be useful. If you do not want to maintain a local index, and if the user can access a high percentage of the total, meaning that the user is more likely than not to have access to the results returned by the search query, then Search then Check would work just as well. Use-case: Searching on Twitter. Most Twitter users have their profiles set to public, so the user is more likely to have access to the tweets when performing a search. So searching first then running checks against the set of returned results would be appropriate.","s":"Choosing the best option","u":"/integration/advanced/search-with-permissions","h":"#choosing-the-best-option","p":7},{"i":20,"t":"Scenario Use Case # of objects returned from database query # of objects user can access in a type % of objects user can access in a type Preferred Option A Search criteria enough to narrow down results Low - - 1 B Few objects the user has access to, but still a high % of total objects Low Low High 1 C Cannot narrow down search results, very high probability search returns objects user cannot access, total number of objects user can access is low enough to fit in a response High Low Low 3 or 2 D Google Drive: User has access to a lot of documents, but low percentage from total High High Low 2 E Twitter Search: Most profiles are public, and the user can access them High High High 1 or 2","s":"Summary","u":"/integration/advanced/search-with-permissions","h":"#summary","p":7},{"i":22,"t":"note OpenFGA is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution based on Google's Zanzibar.

We welcome community contribution to this project. The OpenFGA service answers authorization checks by determining whether a relationship exists between an object and a user. Checks takes into consideration the authorization model of the system and the relationship tuples present in the system at that time in order to make a decision. In this guide you will learn about the most relevant FGA concepts, such as a type or an authorization model, and you will be able to explore them using the FGA playground. What is a type?​ A type is a string. It should define a class of objects with similar characteristics. Examples of types: workspace repository organization document What is a type definition?​ A type definition is a configuration that defines all possible relations a user or another object can have in relation to this type. Code snippet below is an example of a type definition: DSL JSON type document relations define viewer as self define commenter as self define editor as self define owner as self { \"type\": \"document\", \"relations\": { \"viewer\": { \"this\": {} }, \"commenter\": { \"this\": {} }, \"editor\": { \"this\": {} }, \"owner\": { \"this\": {} } }} What is an authorization model?​ An authorization model is a combination of one or more type definitions. This is used to define the permission model of a system. Code snippet below is an example of an authorization model: DSL JSON type document relations define viewer as self define commenter as self define editor as self define owner as selftype domain relations define member as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"document\", \"relations\": { \"viewer\": { \"this\": {} }, \"commenter\": { \"this\": {} }, \"editor\": { \"this\": {} }, \"owner\": { \"this\": {} } } }, { \"type\": \"domain\", \"relations\": { \"member\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} Authorization model, together with relationship tuples, allow determination of whether a relationship exists between a user and an object. The OpenFGA service has two different syntaxes to define the authorization model: A JSON syntax accepted by the OpenFGA API that follows closely the original syntax discussed in the Zanzibar Paper. See Equivalent Zanzibar Concepts. A DSL that we believe is easier to use and is used in the Auth0 FGA Playground to help with modeling. This is translated to the API-supported syntax before being sent to the API. Learn more about the OpenFGA Configuration Language. What is a store?​ A store is a OpenFGA organization entity that owns an authorization model. A store contains all your data, including the authorization model and relationship tuples. What is an object?​ An object represents an entity in the system. We can define how various users have a relationship to it through relationship tuples and the authorization model. An object is a combination of a type and an identifier. For example: workspace:fb83c013-3060-41f4-9590-d3233a67938f repository:auth0/express-jwt organization:org_ajUc9kJ document:new-roadmap User, relation and object are the building blocks for relationship tuples. For more information, please see Modeling Basics. What is a user?​ A user is an entity in the system that can be related to an object. A user is any identifier: e.g. anne or 4179af14-f0c0-4930-88fd-5570c7bf6f59 any object: e.g. workspace:fb83c013-3060-41f4-9590-d3233a67938f, repository:auth0/express-jwt or organization:org_ajUc9kJ a group or a set of users (also called a userset): e.g. organization:org_ajUc9kJ#members, which represents the set of users related to the object organization:org_ajUc9kJ as member everyone, using the special syntax: * User, relation and object are the building blocks for relationship tuples. For more information, please see Modeling Basics. What is a relation?​ A relation is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between objects of this type and other users in the system. Examples of relation: User can be a reader of a document Team can administer a repo User can be a member of a team What is a relation definition?​ A relation definition lists the conditions or requirements under which this relationship would be possible. For example: editor describing a possible relationship between a user and an object in the document type allows the following: user identifier to object relationship: the user id anne is related to the object document:roadmap as editor object to object relationship: the object application:ifft is related to the object document:roadmap as editor userset to object relationship: the userset organization:auth0.com#member is related to document:roadmap as editor indicating that the set of users who are related to the object organization:auth0.com as member are related to the object document:roadmap as editors this allows for potential solutions to use-cases like sharing a document internally with all members of a company or a team everyone to object relationship: everyone (*) is related to document:roadmap as editor this is how one could model publicly editable documents These would be defined in the authorization model as such: DSL JSON type document relations define viewer as self define commenter as self define editor as self define owner as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"document\", \"relations\": { \"viewer\": { \"this\": {} }, \"commenter\": { \"this\": {} }, \"editor\": { \"this\": {} }, \"owner\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} info In the configuration of the document type, we have four relations: viewer, commenter, editor and owner. User, relation and object are the building blocks for relationship tuples. For more information, please see Modeling Basics. What is a relationship tuple?​ A relationship tuple is a tuple consisting of a user, relation and object stored in OpenFGA . A relationship tuple consists of a: user, e.g. anne, 3f7768e0-4fa7-4e93-8417-4da68ce1846c, workspace:auth0 or folder:planning#editor relation, e.g. editor, member or parent_workspace object, e.g repo:auth0/express_jwt, domain:auth0.com or channel:marketing An authorization model, together with relationship tuples, allow the determination of whether a relationship exists between a user and an object. Throughout the documentation, you will encounter relationship tuples represented as: [ { \"user\": \"anne\", \"relation\": \"editor\", \"object\": \"document:new-roadmap\", },] For more information, please see Modeling Basics. What is a relationship?​ A relationship is the realization of a relation between a user and an object. An authorization model, together with relationship tuples, allow the determination of whether a relationship exists between a user and an object. Relationships may be classified as direct or implied. What are direct and implied relationships?​ A direct relationship R between user X and object Y means the relationship tuple (user=X, relation=R, object=Y) exists, and the OpenFGA authorization model for that relation allows this direct relationship (by use of self). An implied (or computed) relationship R exists between user X and object Y if user X is related to an object Z that is in a direct or implied relationship with object Y, and the OpenFGA authorization model allows it. anne has a direct relationship with document:new-roadmap as viewer if the type definition allows it (allows self), and one of the following relationship tuples exist: [ // Anne is directly related to the document { \"user\": \"anne\", \"relation\": \"viewer\", \"object\": \"document:new-roadmap\", },] [ // Everyone (`*`) is directly related to the document { \"user\": \"*\", \"relation\": \"viewer\", \"object\": \"document:new-roadmap\", },] [ // The userset is directly related to this document { \"user\": \"team:product#member\", \"relation\": \"viewer\", \"object\": \"document:new-roadmap\", }, // AND Anne is a member of a userset (e.g. team:product#member) { \"user\": \"anne\", \"relation\": \"member\", \"object\": \"team:product#member\", },] anne has an implied relationship with document:new-roadmap as viewer if the type definition allows it, and the presence of relationship tuples satisfying the relationship exist. For example, assuming the following type definition: DSL JSON type document relations define viewer as self or editor define editor as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"document\", \"relations\": { \"viewer\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"editor\" } } ] } }, \"editor\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} And assuming the following relationship tuple exists in the system: [ { \"user\": \"anne\", \"relation\": \"editor\", \"object\": \"document:new-roadmap\", },] In this case, the relationship between anne and document:new-roadmap as a viewer is implied from the direct editor relationship anne has with that same document. Thus, the following request to check whether a viewer relationship exists between anne and document:new-roadmap will return true.

This can be done using the check methods in the OpenFGA SDKs (JavaScript SDK/Go SDK/.NET SDK), by manually calling the check endpoint using curl, or in your code. The check endpoint responds with { \"allowed\": true } if a relationship exists, and with { \"allowed\": false } if the relationship does not. For example, the following will check whether anne has a viewer relation to document:new-roadmap: Node.js Go .NET curl Pseudocode Initialize the SDK // ApiTokenIssuer, ApiAudience, ClientId and ClientSecret are optional.// import the SDKconst { OpenFgaApi } = require('@openfga/sdk');// Initialize the SDK with no auth - see \"How to setup SDK client\" for more optionsconst fgaClient = new OpenFgaApi({ storeId: process.env.FGA_STORE_ID, apiHost: process.env.FGA_API_HOST,}); // Run a checkconst { allowed } = await fgaClient.check({ tuple_key: { user: 'anne', relation: 'viewer', object: 'document:new-roadmap', },});// allowed = true Initialize the SDK // ApiTokenIssuer, ApiAudience, ClientId and ClientSecret are optional.import ( fgaSdk \"github.com/openfga/go-sdk\" \"os\")func Main() { // Initialize the SDK with no auth - see \"How to setup SDK client\" for more options configuration, err := fgaSdk.NewConfiguration(fgaSdk.UserConfiguration{ ApiHost: os.Getenv(\"FGA_API_HOST\"), ApiScheme: os.Getenv(\"FGA_SCHEME\"), // Either \"http\" or \"https\" StoreId: os.Getenv(\"FGA_STORE_ID\"), }) if err != nil { // ..

What are contextual tuples?​ Contextual tuples are tuples that are sent alongside a check request, and only exist within the context of that particular request. Similar to relationship tuples, contextual tuples are composed of a user, relation and object. Unlike relationship tuples, they are not written to the system state. However, if contextual tuples are sent alongside a check request, in the context of this particular check request, they are treated as have been written to the system state. For more information, please see Contextual and Time-Based Authorization, Authorization Through Organization Context and Check API Request Documentation. How do I represent \"everyone\"?​ In OpenFGA the special syntax * means everyone when used as user in a relationship tuple. For example, in a case where you would like to indicate a certain document document:new-roadmap is publicly writable (i.e. has everyone as an editor), you can add the following relationship tuple: [ { \"user\": \"*\", \"relation\": \"editor\", \"object\": \"document:new-roadmap\", },] Note that * has no special meaning when used in other contexts. For example, workspace:* as an object means a single object with the type workspace and identifier the string *.

When to use Object-to-Object relationships, combined with a configured authorization model can be used to indicate that a user's relation with one object can influence their relationship with another object. This can also be used in some cases to remove the need to modify relations between objects using user groups. Object-to-object relationships can be used: To indicate that managers of an employee have access to approve requests the employee has made To indicate that users who have a repository admin role (repo_admin) in an organization automatically have admin access to all repositories in that organization To indicate that users who are subscribed to a plan, get access to all the features in that plan","s":"Modeling Parent-Child Objects","u":"/modeling/basics/parent-child","h":"","p":231},{"i":234,"t":"In order to understand this guide correctly you must be familiar with some OpenFGA Concepts and know how to develop the things that we will list below.

We welcome community contribution to this project. In this guide you will learn how to model roles and permissions model within OpenFGA using the authorization model and relationship tuple. Roles are assigned to users or a group of users, where any user can have more than one role (editor, owner, etc..). Permissions are what allows users to access certain objects based on their specific roles (device_renamer, channel_archiver, etc..). For example, the role viewer of a trip can have permissions to view bookings or the role owners can have permissions to add/view bookings to a trip. When to use When trying to create a role and permissions model within OpenFGA.: Create roles by creating relations that can be directly assigned to users Assign permissions by creating relations that users get through other relations For example: Grant someone an admin role that can edit and read a document Grant someone a security_guard role that can live_video_viewer on a device Grant someone a viewer role that can view_products on a shop There are advantages to implementing roles and permissions within OpenFGA, such as: Breaking down existing roles to have more fine grained permissions. This allows your application to check whether a user has access to a certain object without having to explicitly check that specific users role. Introduce new roles/permissions or consolidate roles without affecting your application behavior. For example: if in your app all the checks are for the fine permissions check('bob', 'booking_adder', 'trip:Europe') instead of check('bob', 'owner', 'trip:Europe'), and then you later decide owners can no longer add bookings to a trip, you can remove the relation within the trip type with no code changes in your application, and all the permissions will automatically honor the change.","s":"Modeling Roles and Permissions","u":"/modeling/basics/roles-and-permissions","h":"","p":289},{"i":292,"t":"In order to understand this guide correctly you must be familiar with some OpenFGA Concepts and know how to develop the things that we will list below.

To add permissions related to bookings, we can add new relations to the trip object type denoting the various actions a user can take on trips (view, edit, delete, rename, etc...) To allow viewers of a trip to have permissions to view bookings and owners to have permissions to add/view bookings, we would modify the type as the following: DSL JSON type trip relations define owner as self define viewer as self define booking_adder as owner define booking_viewer as viewer or owner { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"trip\", \"relations\": { \"owner\": { \"this\": {} }, \"viewer\": { \"this\": {} }, \"booking_adder\": { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"owner\" } }, \"booking_viewer\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"viewer\" } }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"owner\" } } ] } } } } ]} Note: notice how both booking_viewer and booking_adder don't have the self syntax, this is to ensure that the relation can only be assigned through the role and not directly.","s":"02.

We'll guide you through it. authorization checks ReBAC systems determine access from a user's relation to an object.

You're probably more familiar with the authorization requirements for this feature than other less important use cases. Important Requirement clarity is fundamental when defining an authorization model. The scope of the feature is not important at this point. You can always iterate later. Write it in plain language​ Once you've picked a feature, describe its authorization related scope using simple language. Avoid using the word \"roles\", as this ties you to an RBAC way of thinking. info Roles don't \"disappear\" in ReBAC systems like OpenFGA. Your users might have roles on a given object, rather than the entire system. But starting from the term \"role\" might lead you down the wrong path. Instead it is better to discover roles while you are modeling. Your feature description should include the objects, users and groups of users participating in the system. Sentences should look like this: A user {user} can perform action {action} to/on/in {object types} ...

At this stage we will encode the answers to the question we asked at the beginning of the document:. Why could a user U, perform an action A on an object O? We are going to go over each type and each of its relations and create a definition for it. Type: Organization​ We recommend starting from objects that represent groups/containers of users. For features in most systems these are easy to define and help reason about the other types. Examples of type names for these are \"team\", \"group\", \"organization\", etc. Relation: member​ The member relation is used to tell OpenFGA about the members of an organization. Important Relation names in OpenFGA are arbitrary strings. There are no reserved relation names. You can use \"member\" or \"part_of\" or anything else to refer to a user that is part of a team/organization. Remember \"How a user is added as a member to an organization is beyond the scope of this feature.\" For the purposes of this model the relation definition should be: define member as self Why? This relation definition states: That organizations have members That the members of an organization with id {id} are all users described by tuples of the form: { user: {user-id}, relation: \"member\", object: \"organization:{id}\" } Important Relation definitions of the form “define {relation} as self\" are fairly common. They are used to express that relationships \"to the object with that relation\" (e.g. \"member of organization\") can be assigned by your system and that only the users that have that relation are those with a direct relationship. You can read more about group membership and types in Modeling User Groups. Side note This also automatically supports nested organizational membership if you want such a feature in your system. You could use relationship tuples like the following one to express that \"members of organization A are members of organization B\": { user: \"organization:A#member\", relation: \"member\", object: \"organization:B\"} If you want to learn more, you can read further about this in Modelling User Groups and Managing Relationships Between Objects. Complete Type Definition​ The complete type definition for the organization type is: type organization relations define member as self Type: Document​ After defining your \"group\" like types, continue with the most important type for the feature: the one that allows the main use case. In this case \"document\", since the main use case for users is to create, write, read and collaborate on documents. Defining relations for the main type lets you to focus on your core use case, and will likely make other type definitions easier. Relation: owner​ The owner relation is used to tell OpenFGA which users are owners of the document. Important In the current version, there is no way to state that there is only one owner in the authorization model. The application must limit this set of users to just one owner if that is a requirement. When a document is created, a relationship tuple will be stored in OpenFGA representing this relationship between owner and document. This is an example of a user to object relationship. The relation definition then should be: define owner as self Why? This relation definition states that: each document can have one or more owners owners of a document are assignable by creating a tuple of the format { user: \"{user_id}\", relation: \"owner\", object: \"document:{id}\" } for individual users Relation: editor​ The editor relation is used to tell OpenFGA which users are editors of the document. When a user shares a document with another user or set of users as editor, a relationship tuple will be stored in OpenFGA representing this relationship between editor and document. This is an example of a users to object relationship. The relation definition then should be: define editor as self Why? This relation definition states that: each document can have editors the editor(s) of a document are assignable by creating a tuple with shape { user: \"{user_id}\", relation: \"editor\", object: \"document:{id}\" } for individual users This also supports making all members in an organization editors of the document, through a group to object relationship. A relationship tuple like the following one states that the members of organization A are editors of document 0001. [ { \"user\": \"organization:A#member\", \"relation\": \"editor\", \"object\": \"document:0001\", },] You can learn more about this in Modeling User Groups. Relation: viewer​ The viewer relation is similar to the document's editor relation. It will be defined like this: define viewer as self Relation: parent​ The parent relation is used to tell OpenFGA which folder or drive is the parent of the document. Important Relation names in OpenFGA are arbitrary strings. There are no reserved relation names. You can use \"parent\", \"container\" or \"ancestor\" to refer to a \"parent folder\". This relation is different from the others we have seen so far, as it is a relation between two objects (a folder and or drive that is the parent of the document). This is known as an object to object relationship, of which parent-child is a particular case. When a document is created a relationship tuple will be stored in OpenFGA to represent this relationship between parent and document. The relation definition then should be: define parent as self Why? This relation definition states that: documents may have a parent the parent(s) of a document with id {id} (either a folder a folder or drive, as set by the system) described by one of these relationship tuples: { user: \"folder:{id}\", relation: \"parent\", object: \"document:{id}\" } { user: \"drive:{id}\", relation: \"parent\", object: \"document:{id}\" } Important In the current OpenFGA version, there is no way to state that a document's parent is either a drive or folder. The application must enforce this. Side note You might have noticed that the \"user\" in the tuple is an object. This is a special syntax OpenFGA accepts in the \"user\" parameter to write object to object relationships. You can read more about writing data to manage object to object relationships in Managing Relationships Between Objects. Relation: can_share​ We need to express the following in the relation definition: A user can share a document with another user or an organization as either editor or viewer if they are an owner or editor of a document or if they are an owner of the folder that is the parent of the document. We can achieve that with the following definition using OpenFGA Configuration Language: define can_share as owner or editor or owner from parent There are a few key things here: We don't use self as part of the definition. can_share is a common example of representing a permission that is defined in terms of other relations but is not directly assignable by the system. The relation definition contains a union operator separating a list of relations that the user must have with the object in order to \"be able to share the document\". It is any of: Being an owner of the document Being an editor of the document Being an owner of the parent of the document. Whether the parent is a drive or a folder is not important, as they both have an owner relation. You can read more about the aforementioned items in Modeling Roles and Permissions. Relation: can_view​ We need to express the following in the relation definition: A user can view a document if they are an owner, viewer or editor of a document or if they are a viewer, owner of the folder/drive that is the parent of the document. Similar to the can_share relation, we can achieve that with the following definition using OpenFGA Configuration Language: define can_view as viewer or editor or viewer from parent or owner from parent Relation: can_write​ We need to express the following in the relation definition: A user can write a document if they are an owner or editor of a document or if they are an owner or editor of the folder/drive that is the parent of the document. Similar to the can_share relation, we can achieve that with the following definition using OpenFGA Configuration Language: define can_write as editor or owner or owner from parent Relation: can_change_owner​ We need to express the following in the relation definition: A user can change the owner of a document if they are an owner of the document. Similar to the can_share relation, we can achieve that with the following definition using OpenFGA Configuration Language: define can_change_owner as owner Complete Type Definition​ The complete type definition for the document type is: type document relations define owner as self define editor as self define viewer as self define parent as self define can_share as owner or editor or owner from parent define can_view as viewer or editor or owner or viewer from parent or editor from parent or owner from parent define can_write as editor or owner or owner from parent define can_change_owner as owner Combining the type definitions for document and organization, we have type organization relations define member as selftype document relations define owner as self define editor as self define viewer as self define parent as self define can_share as owner or editor or owner from parent define can_view as viewer or editor or owner or viewer from parent or editor from parent or owner from parent define can_write as editor or owner or owner from parent define can_change_owner as owner note The OpenFGA authorization model API and SDK only accepts JSON in its input.

Define relations","u":"/modeling/getting-started","h":"#04-define-relations","p":362},{"i":377,"t":"Once you have defined your group like types and the most important type for your feature you want to ensure everything is working as expected. This means testing the model. How? Remember from the introduction that OpenFGA's main job is to answer the question: Can user U, perform an action A on an object O? The OpenFGA service does that by checking if a user has a particular relationship to an object, based on your authorization model and relationship tuples. General Authorization Check \"Can user U perform action A on object O?\" OpenFGA (ReBAC) Authorization Check \"Can user U have relation R with object O?\" What we want is to ensure that given our current authorization model and some sample relationship tuples, we get the expected results for those questions. So we'll write some relationship tuples and assertions. An OpenFGA assertion takes one of these forms: user U has relation R with object O user U does not have relation R with object O Much like automated tests and assertions work for programming languages, you can use assertions to prevent regressions while you change your tuples and authorization model. Essentially, assertions help you ensure things work like you expect them to work as you iterate. Write Relationship Tuples​ The relationship tuples should represent real examples from your system with fake data. At this point you haven't defined the drive or folder types, so you can only test things based on users or organization members' relationships to documents. Let's imagine an example setup and write the relationship tuples for it: System Action Relationship Tuple Anne is a member of the contoso organization { user:\"anne\", relation: \"member\", object: \"organization:contoso\"} Beth is a member of fabrikam organization { user:\"beth\", relation: \"member\", object: \"organization:fabrikam\"} Anne creates document:1, becomes its owner. { user:\"anne\", relation: \"owner\", object: \"document:1\"} Anne shares document:1 with all members of the fabrikam organization as editor. { user:\"organization:fabrikam#member\", relation: \"editor\", object: \"document:1\"} Beth creates document:2 and becomes its owner. { user:\"beth\", relation: \"owner\", object: \"document:2\"} Beth shares document:2 with all members of the contoso organization as viewer { user:\"organization:contoso#member\", relation: \"viewer\", object: \"document:2\"} Follow these steps to create relationship tuples. Create Assertions​ According to our written down model and the relationship tuples from the previous step, these assertions should be specified: Because anne is the owner of document:1: user anne has relation can_share with document:1 user anne has relation can_write with document:1 user anne has relation can_view with document:1 user anne has relation can_change_owner with document:1 Because beth is a member of organization:fabrikam and members of organization:fabrikam are writer of document:1: user beth does not have relation can_share with document:1 user beth has relation can_write with document:1 user beth has relation can_view with document:1 user beth does not have relation can_change_owner with document:1 Because beth is the owner of document:2: user beth has relation can_share with document:2 user beth has relation can_write with document:2 user beth has relation can_view with document:2 user beth has relation can_change_owner with document:2 Because anne is a member of organization:contoso and members of organization:contoso are viewer of document:2: user anne does not have relation can_share with document:2 user anne does not have relation can_write with document:2 user anne has relation can_view with document:2 user anne does not have relation can_change_owner with document:2 Follow these steps to create assertions. Run Assertions​ Run the assertions. They should all pass. If they don't you can use the query view to understand what is causing them to fail, and then update your authorization model and relation tuples accordingly. Once all the assertions are working, you should continue the iterative process of working on your model.","s":"05.

We welcome community contribution to this project. The OpenFGA's Configuration Language is used to build a representation of a system's authorization model. It informs OpenFGA's API on what the object types in the system are and how they could relate to one another. It describes the relations possible on an object of a certain type and lists the conditions under which one is related to that object. The DSL and the JSON syntax are two presentations of that configuration language. The JSON syntax is accepted by the API and closely matches the API described in the Zanzibar paper. The DSL is syntactic sugar on top of the JSON syntax and compiles down to it before being sent to OpenFGA's API. The DSL is meant to make modeling easier and more intuitive. You'll encounter the JSON syntax when calling the API directly or through the SDKs, and the DSL when interacting with OpenFGA through the Playground. Throughout the documentation you can switch between the two presentations.

A user joins a GitHub organization and gains access to the organizations private repositories. A student graduates from school and loses access to the school's facilities. These are cases where using group membership can be helpful as you do not need to iterate over all of the group's resources to add or revoke access to particular objects.

Once the user loads the Pull Request page, the frontend needs to know whether it can show the \"Draft Pull Request\" option, as in it needs to know: \"Does the current user have access to feature Draft Pull Request?\".

You will keep iterating and updating the authorization model until the results of the queries match what you expect. caution In production, it is highly recommended to use unique, immutable identifiers. Names are used in this article to make it easier to read and follow. For example, the relationship tuple indicating that anne is a member of organization:alpha could be written as: user: 2b4840f2-7c9c-42c8-9329-911002051524 relation: member object: project:52e529c6-c571-4d5c-b78a-bc574cf98b54 Verification​ Now that you have some data, you can start using it to ask is ${USER} related to ${OBJECT} as ${RELATION}? First, you will check if anne is a member of organization:alpha. This is one of the relationship tuples you previously added, you will make sure OpenFGA can detect a relation in this case.

A direct relationship R between user X and object Y means the relationship tuple (user=X, relation=R, object=Y) exists, and the OpenFGA authorization model for that relation allows this direct relationship (by use of self). An implied relationship R exists between user X and object Y if user X is related to an object Z that is in direct or implied relationship with object Y, and the OpenFGA authorization model allows it. The resulting updated configuration would be: DSL JSON type feature relations define associated_plan as self define access as selftype plan relations define subscriber as selftype organization relations define member as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"feature\", \"relations\": { \"associated_plan\": { \"this\": {} }, \"access\": { \"this\": {} } } }, { \"type\": \"plan\", \"relations\": { \"subscriber\": { \"this\": {} } } }, { \"type\": \"organization\", \"relations\": { \"member\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} Adding modeling pattern of parent-child objects​ Now we can ask the following query: is anne related to feature:issues as access? again.

In other words, users related as all_objects_viewer to any of this object's parents are related as viewer to this object. If you want to give all subscribers on a plan access to a feature, you can do it like so: DSL JSON type feature relations define associated_plan as self define access as self or subscriber from associated_plan { \"type\": \"feature\", \"relations\": { \"associated_plan\": { \"this\": {} }, \"access\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"tupleToUserset\": { \"tupleset\": { \"relation\": \"associated_plan\" }, \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"subscriber\" } } } ] } } }} info users related to feature as access are the union of (any of): the set of users with a direct access relation the set of users related to the associated_plan as subscriber (the feature's associated plans' subscribers) So everyone who has direct access, as well as the subscribers of the associated plan That would mean that in order for an object to have an access relation to a feature y, there needs to be either a: a direct relationship via a relationship tuple: e.g. { \"user\": \"x\", \"relation\": \"access\", \"object\": \"feature:y\" } subscriber relationship with another object related to x associated_plan: e.g. { \"user\": \"x\", \"relation\": \"subscriber\", \"object\": \"plan:z\" } { \"user\": \"plan:z\", \"relation\": \"associated_plan\", \"object\": \"feature:y\" } That brings you close. That will allow you to grant organizations access to the feature (as organizations have a subscriber relation with the plan). Adding subscriber relationship with another object related to x associated_plan​ One way forward would be to add a direct access relation between a user and a feature e.g. { \"user\": \"anne\", \"relation\": \"access\", \"object\": \"feature:y\" } whenever the organization anne is subscribed to a plan, or the organization anne is in subscribes to a new plan. But there are several downsides to this: Your application layer now needs to worry about computing this relationship. Instead of letting OpenFGA figure this all out, the app layer needs to do the checks whenever a user is being added or removed If an organization changes its subscription, your application layer has to loop through all the users and update their access relationships to features accordingly Later in this tutorial, you will remove the possibility of having a direct access relation completely, but for now you will make sure the changes to the store you have made so far are working. Replace all the existing code you had previously with the updated authorization model from the below snippet. DSL JSON type feature relations define associated_plan as self define access as self or subscriber from associated_plantype plan relations define subscriber as selftype organization relations define member as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"feature\", \"relations\": { \"associated_plan\": { \"this\": {} }, \"access\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"tupleToUserset\": { \"tupleset\": { \"relation\": \"associated_plan\" }, \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"subscriber\" } } } ] } } } }, { \"type\": \"plan\", \"relations\": { \"subscriber\": { \"this\": {} } } }, { \"type\": \"organization\", \"relations\": { \"member\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} Now we can ask following query: is organization:alpha related to feature:issues as access? again.

From that and the authorization model you updated above, OpenFGA deduced that organization:alpha has an implied access relation to feature:issues. That is good, but you want to be able to ask is anne related to feature:issues as access?, not is organization:alpha related to feature:issues as access?. As in, you want the subscriber members to have access to the feature, not the subscriber itself. In order to do that, you will add a relation on the plan, that indicates that all members of an organization subscribed to it, have a subscriber_member relation to the plan. And you can modify the change you did above to give implied access to the subscriber_member instead of the subscriber. Like so: DSL JSON type feature relations define associated_plan as self define access as self or subscriber_member from associated_plantype plan relations define subscriber as self define subscriber_member as member from subscribertype organization relations define member as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"feature\", \"relations\": { \"associated_plan\": { \"this\": {} }, \"access\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"tupleToUserset\": { \"tupleset\": { \"relation\": \"associated_plan\" }, \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"subscriber_member\" } } } ] } } } }, { \"type\": \"plan\", \"relations\": { \"subscriber\": { \"this\": {} }, \"subscriber_member\": { \"tupleToUserset\": { \"tupleset\": { \"relation\": \"subscriber\" }, \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"member\" } } } } }, { \"type\": \"organization\", \"relations\": { \"member\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} info Notice that subscriber has been updated to subscriber_member in the access relation of the feature type. Under the plan type, in order for someone to have a subscriber_member relation to the plan, they have to be related as a member to the object related as a subscriber to the plan (as in they have to be a member of on of the plan's subscribers). Now ask the following query: is anne related to feature:issues as access?

Earlier on, the idea of not allowing a direct access relation between a user and a feature was discussed, e.g. adding a relationship tuple like { \"user\": \"anne\", \"relation\": \"access\", \"object\": \"feature:y\" }. You will remove it now. To disallow a direct relationship, you need to remove self. The following snippet: DSL JSON type feature relations define associated_plan as self define access as self or subscriber_member from associated_plan { \"type\": \"feature\", \"relations\": { \"associated_plan\": { \"this\": {} }, \"access\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"tupleToUserset\": { \"tupleset\": { \"relation\": \"associated_plan\" }, \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"subscriber_member\" } } } ] } } }} becomes DSL JSON type feature relations define associated_plan as self define access as subscriber_member from associated_plan { \"type\": \"feature\", \"relations\": { \"associated_plan\": { \"this\": {} }, \"access\": { \"tupleToUserset\": { \"tupleset\": { \"relation\": \"associated_plan\" }, \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"subscriber_member\" } } } }} With this change, even if your app layer added the following relationship tuple: { \"user\": \"anne\", \"relation\": \"access\", \"object\": feature:issues } a subsequent check for is anne related to feature:issues as access? would return no relation. The only way for a relation to exist is if the following three relationship tuples do: { \"user\": \"anne\", \"relation\": \"member\", \"object\": \"organization:z\" } { \"user\": \"organization:z\", \"relation\": \"subscriber\", \"object\": \"plan:y\" } { \"user\": \"plan:y\", \"relation\": \"associated_plan\", \"object\": \"feature:issues\" } Verification​ Ensure that your authorization model matches the one below DSL JSON type feature relations define associated_plan as self define access as subscriber_member from associated_plantype plan relations define subscriber as self define subscriber_member as member from subscribertype organization relations define member as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"feature\", \"relations\": { \"associated_plan\": { \"this\": {} }, \"access\": { \"tupleToUserset\": { \"tupleset\": { \"relation\": \"associated_plan\" }, \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"subscriber_member\" } } } } }, { \"type\": \"plan\", \"relations\": { \"subscriber\": { \"this\": {} }, \"subscriber_member\": { \"tupleToUserset\": { \"tupleset\": { \"relation\": \"subscriber\" }, \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"member\" } } } } }, { \"type\": \"organization\", \"relations\": { \"member\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} You will now verify that the configuration is correct by running checks for all the scenarios mentioned at the beginning of the tutorial: Anne has access to Issues (expecting yes) Anne has access to Draft Pull Requests (expecting no) Anne has access to Single Sign-on (expecting no) Beth has access to Issues (expecting yes) Beth has access to Draft Pull Requests (expecting yes) Beth has access to Single Sign-on (expecting no) Charles has access to Issues (expecting yes) Charles has access to Draft Pull Requests (expecting yes) Charles has access to Single Sign-on (expecting yes) Node.js Go .NET curl Pseudocode Initialize the SDK // ApiTokenIssuer, ApiAudience, ClientId and ClientSecret are optional.// import the SDKconst { OpenFgaApi } = require('@openfga/sdk');// Initialize the SDK with no auth - see \"How to setup SDK client\" for more optionsconst fgaClient = new OpenFgaApi({ storeId: process.env.FGA_STORE_ID, apiHost: process.env.FGA_API_HOST,}); // Run a checkconst { allowed } = await fgaClient.check({ tuple_key: { user: 'anne', relation: 'access', object: 'feature:issues', },});// allowed = true Initialize the SDK // ApiTokenIssuer, ApiAudience, ClientId and ClientSecret are optional.import ( fgaSdk \"github.com/openfga/go-sdk\" \"os\")func Main() { // Initialize the SDK with no auth - see \"How to setup SDK client\" for more options configuration, err := fgaSdk.NewConfiguration(fgaSdk.UserConfiguration{ ApiHost: os.Getenv(\"FGA_API_HOST\"), ApiScheme: os.Getenv(\"FGA_SCHEME\"), // Either \"http\" or \"https\" StoreId: os.Getenv(\"FGA_STORE_ID\"), }) if err != nil { // ..

At the end of this section we want to have the following permissions represented: To represent permissions in OpenFGA we use relations. For document permissions we need to create the following authorization model: DSL JSON type document relations define owner as self define writer as self define commenter as self define viewer as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"document\", \"relations\": { \"owner\": { \"this\": {} }, \"writer\": { \"this\": {} }, \"commenter\": { \"this\": {} }, \"viewer\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} The OpenFGA service determines if a user has access to an object by checking if the user has a relation to that object. Let us examine one of those relations in detail: DSL JSON type document relations define viewer as self { \"type\": \"document\", \"relations\": { \"viewer\": { \"this\": {} } }} info The snippet above indicates that objects of type document have users related to them as \"viewer\" if those users belong to the userset of all users related to the document as \"viewer\".

At the end of this section we want to end up with the following permissions represented: We need to introduce the notion of organization as a type, user organization membership and repository ownership as a relation. - It is worth calling that before this addition we were able to represent almost the entire GitHub repo permissions without adding the notion of organization to OpenFGA. Identifiers for users, repositories and teams were all that was necessary. Let us add support for organizations and membership.

Inserting some relationship tuples","u":"/modeling/advanced/use-cases/iot","h":"#02-inserting-some-relationship-tuples","p":594},{"i":613,"t":"Notice how you had to add the Anne and Beth as direct relations to all the actions they can take on Device 1 instead of just stating that they are related as Security Guard or IT Admin, and having the other permissions implied? In practice this might have some disadvantages: if your authorization model changes, (e.g so that Security Guards can no longer view previously recorded videos), you would need to change relationship tuples in the system instead of just changing the configuration. We can address this by using concentric relation models. It allows you to express that sets of users who have a relation X to the object also have relation Y. For example, anyone that is related to the device as a security_guard is also related as a live_video_viewer and recorded_video_viewer, and anyone who is related to the device as an it_admin is also related as a live_video_viewer, a recorded_video_viewer, and a device_renamer. At the end you want to make sure that checking if Anne, Beth, Charles, or Dianne have permission to view the live video or rename the device, will get you the correct answers back. The resulting authorization model is: DSL JSON type device relations define it_admin as self define security_guard as self define live_video_viewer as self or it_admin or security_guard define recorded_video_viewer as self or it_admin or security_guard define device_renamer as self or it_admin { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"device\", \"relations\": { \"it_admin\": { \"this\": {} }, \"security_guard\": { \"this\": {} }, \"live_video_viewer\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"it_admin\" } }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"security_guard\" } } ] } }, \"recorded_video_viewer\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"it_admin\" } }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"security_guard\" } } ] } }, \"device_renamer\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"it_admin\" } } ] } } } } ]} The requirements are: Anne and Charles are Security Guards with access Device 1 Beth and Dianne are IT Admins with access Device 1 Security Guards can view live and recorded video IT Admins can view live and recorded video and rename devices Instead of adding different relationship tuples with direct relations to the actions they can take, as you did in the previous section, you will only add the relation to their role: it_admin or security_guard.

Modeling Device Groups","u":"/modeling/advanced/use-cases/iot","h":"#04-modeling-device-groups","p":594},{"i":617,"t":"Notice that despite following Step 03, anne and beth still have direct relations to all the actions they can take on device:1. Updating the authorization model​ anne is a live_video_viewer by both her position as security_guard as well as her direct relationship assignment. This is undesirable. Imagine anne left her position of security_guard and she will still have live_video_viewer access to device:1. To remedy this, remove self from live_video_viewer, recorded_video_viewer and device_renamer. This denies direct relations to live_video_viewer, recorded_video_viewer and device_renamer from having an effect. To do this: DSL JSON type device relations define it_admin as self define security_guard as self define live_video_viewer as it_admin or security_guard define recorded_video_viewer as it_admin or security_guard define device_renamer as it_admintype device_group relations define it_admin as self define security_guard as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"device\", \"relations\": { \"it_admin\": { \"this\": {} }, \"security_guard\": { \"this\": {} }, \"live_video_viewer\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"it_admin\" } }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"security_guard\" } } ] } }, \"recorded_video_viewer\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"it_admin\" } }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"security_guard\" } } ] } }, \"device_renamer\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"it_admin\" } } ] } } } }, { \"type\": \"device_group\", \"relations\": { \"it_admin\": { \"this\": {} }, \"security_guard\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} info Notice that any reference to the direct relationship keyword (self in the friendly Syntax - or this in the api syntax) has been removed. That indicates that a user cannot have a direct relationship with an object in this type. With this change, anne can no longer have a live_video_viewer permission for device:1 except through having a security_guard or it_admin role first, and when she loses access to that role, she will automatically lose access to the live_video_viewer permission. Verification​ Now that direct relationship is denied, we should see that anne has live_video_viewer relation to device:1 solely based on her position as security_guard to device:1. Let's find out. To test this, we can add a new user emily. Emily is not a security_guard nor an it_admin.

The returned result should be emily is not related to device:1 as live_video_viewer.

In response, you want to either get a confirmation that person X can indeed do that, or a rejection that they cannot. E.g. does David have access to view #general? The OpenFGA is based on Zanzibar, a Relation Based Access Control system. This means it relies on objects and user relations to perform authorization checks. Setting aside the permissions, you will start with the roles and learn how to express the requirements in terms of relations you can feed into OpenFGA. The requirements stated: Amy is a legacy admin of the Sandcastle workspace Bob is a channels admin of the Sandcastle workspace Catherine and Emily are a normal members of the Sandcastle workspace David is a guest user Here is how you would express than in OpenFGA'sauthorization model: You have a type called \"workspace\", and users can be related to it as a legacy_admin, channels_admin, member and guest DSL JSON type workspace relations define legacy_admin as self define channels_admin as self define member as self define guest as self { \"type\": \"workspace\", \"relations\": { \"legacy_admin\": { \"this\": {} }, \"channels_admin\": { \"this\": {} }, \"member\": { \"this\": {} }, \"guest\": { \"this\": {} } }} info Objects of type workspace have users related to them as: Legacy Admin (legacy_admin) Channels Admin (channels_admin) Member (member) Guest (guest) self (or this in the API Syntax) is the direct relationship keyword and indicates that a user can have a direct relationship with an object of the type the relation specifies.","s":"Modeling Workspaces & Channels","u":"/modeling/advanced/use-cases/slack","h":"#modeling-workspaces--channels","p":622},{"i":637,"t":"To keep things simple and focus on OpenFGA rather than Slack complexity, we will model only four roles (legacy_admin, channels_admin, member, guest). At the end of this section we want to have the following permissions represented User Relation Object amy legacy_admin workspace:sandcastle bob channels_admin workspace:sandcastle catherine member workspace:sandcastle david guest workspace:sandcastle emily member workspace:sandcastle To represent permissions in OpenFGA we use relations. For workspace permissions we need to create the following authorization model: DSL JSON type workspace relations define legacy_admin as self define channels_admin as self define member as self define guest as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"workspace\", \"relations\": { \"legacy_admin\": { \"this\": {} }, \"channels_admin\": { \"this\": {} }, \"member\": { \"this\": {} }, \"guest\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} The OpenFGA service determines if a user has access to an object by checking if the user has a relation to that object. Let us examine one of those relations in detail: DSL JSON type workspace relations define member as self { \"type\": \"workspace\", \"relations\": { \"member\": { \"this\": {} } }} info The snippet above indicates that objects of type workspace have users related to them as \"member\" if those users belong to the userset of all users related to the workspace as \"member\".

But in reality, Amy, who is a legacy_admin already has an implied channels_admin and member relations. In fact anyone (other than a guest) is a member of the workspace. To change this behavior, we will update our system with a concentric relationship model. With the following updated authorization model, you are informing OpenFGA that any user who is related to a workspace as legacy_admin, is also related as a channels_admin and a member . DSL JSON type workspace relations define legacy_admin as self define channels_admin as self or legacy_admin define member as self or channels_admin or legacy_admin define guest as self { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"workspace\", \"relations\": { \"legacy_admin\": { \"this\": {} }, \"channels_admin\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"legacy_admin\" } } ] } }, \"member\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"channels_admin\" } }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"legacy_admin\" } } ] } }, \"guest\": { \"this\": {} } } } ]} We can then verify amy is a member of workspace:sandcastle.

In this task you will expand the model to include the relations concerning the channels. By the end of it, you will run some queries to check whether a user can view or write to a certain channel. Queries such as: is david related to channel:general as viewer? (expected answer: No relation, as David is a guest user with only a relation to #proj-marketing-campaign) is david related to channel:proj_marketing_campaign as viewer? (expected answer: There is a relation, as there is a relation between David and #proj-marketing-campaign as a writer) is bob related to channel:general as viewer? (expected answer: There is a relation, as Bob is a member of the Sandcastle workspace, and all members of the workspace have a viewer relation to #general) The requirements are: Amy, Bob, Catherine and Emily, are normal members of the Sandcastle workspace, they can view all public channels, in this case: #general and #proj-marketing-campaign David, a guest user, has only view and write access to the #proj-marketing-campaign channel Bob and Emily are the only ones with either view or write access to the #marketing-internal channel Amy and Emily are the only ones with write access to the #general channel The possible relations to channels are: Workspace includes the channel, consider the relation that of a parent workspace A user can be a viewer and/or writer on a channel The authorization model already has a section describing the workspace, what remains is describing the channel. That can be done by adding the following section to the configuration above: DSL JSON type channel relations define parent_workspace as self define writer as self define viewer as self { \"type\": \"channel\", \"relations\": { \"parent_workspace\": { \"this\": {} }, \"writer\": { \"this\": {} }, \"viewer\": { \"this\": {} } }} info The configuration snippet above describes a channel that can have the following relations: workspaces related to it as parent_workspace users related to it as writer users related to it as viewer Implied relation​ There is an implied relation that anyone who can write to a channel can also read from it, so the authorization model can be modified to be: DSL JSON type channel relations define parent_workspace as self define writer as self define viewer as self or writer { \"type\": \"channel\", \"relations\": { \"parent_workspace\": { \"this\": {} }, \"writer\": { \"this\": {} }, \"viewer\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"writer\" } } ] } } }} info Note that the channel type definition has been updated to indicate that viewer is the union of: the set of users with a direct viewer relation to this object the set of users with writer relations to this object As a result, the authorization model is: DSL JSON type workspace relations define legacy_admin as self define channels_admin as self or legacy_admin define member as self or channels_admin or legacy_admin define guest as selftype channel relations define parent_workspace as self define writer as self define viewer as self or writer { \"type_definitions\": [ { \"type\": \"workspace\", \"relations\": { \"legacy_admin\": { \"this\": {} }, \"channels_admin\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"legacy_admin\" } } ] } }, \"member\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"channels_admin\" } }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"legacy_admin\" } } ] } }, \"guest\": { \"this\": {} } } }, { \"type\": \"channel\", \"relations\": { \"parent_workspace\": { \"this\": {} }, \"writer\": { \"this\": {} }, \"viewer\": { \"union\": { \"child\": [ { \"this\": {} }, { \"computedUserset\": { \"relation\": \"writer\" } } ] } } } } ]} Updating relationship tuples​ What remains is to add the relationship tuples to indicate the relation between the users, workspace and the channels.

For example: An employee’s ability to access a document when they are connected to the company VPN or the api call is originating from an internal IP address.

There is a relationship tuple specifying that all members of the product team have a viewer relationship with document:planning. Direct relationships are allowed in the viewer relation definition in the document type definition. Note that this is still considered a direct relationship no matter how many resolutions occur on the usersets until the user is found. For example, if our relationship tuples were the following relationship tuples: Dany is a member of the product leads team. Members of the product leads team are members of the product team. Members of the product team are members of the contoso team. Members of the contoso team are viewers of the planning document.

Here we will cover one example of an indirect relationship in order to see how they differ from direct relationships.
