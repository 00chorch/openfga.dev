# Project Information

## Background Information

### Goal

We were inspired by the [Google 2019 Zanzibar's paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/) and believed that [fine grained authorization](https://openfga.dev/docs/authorization-and-openfga#what-is-fine-grained-authorization-fga) at scale allows application developers to model their access control layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization in a way that is consistent across all of their applications.

### History

OpenFGA was originally created by Okta's [Auth0 FGA](https://docs.fga.dev/) team in 2021. It was open-sourced in June 2022 and accepted by the CNCF team for [CNCF Sandbox](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/) in September 2022.
